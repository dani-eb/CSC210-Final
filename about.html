        This is our sales throughout the years 2016-2019. 2016 
        was the release year with a release date of January 27, 
        2016. We accumulated around 3.7 Billion and sold aproximately 
        925,000,000 cans at $3.99 each. The seond year of 2017 
        wasn't as good because the novelty of our item slightly wore 
        off. The sales for the year came in just under 1.5 bil.

        Thankfully, 2018 and 2019 were better with sales at 2.6 bil and 3 
        bil respectivly. We are currently on the stock market and stocks 
        are going for $65 each. We have a few sponsorships in place and 
        have been a sponsor at a few gaming competitions. The easy and 
        no refrigeration has helped push this kickstart to the frontlines 
        of gamer's diets.
